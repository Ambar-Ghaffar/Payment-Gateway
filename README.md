# Donation_Payment_Gateway_integration
Payment Gateways are methods by which you can collect donations on your site with the GiveWP WPplugin. But the purpose of a “Gateway” is to keep all of the private donor information safe and secure. This means specifically that a Gateway’s main purpose is to send your donors sensitive information (specifically credit card information) encrypted to the payment processor (like PayPal or Stripe, etc.) without saving it on your site at all.
